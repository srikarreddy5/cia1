In Kruskal's algorithm, the idea is to sort the edges in ascending order by their weight and pick them up in order and include them in the MST of explored nodes/edges if they do not already form a cycle with any explored nodes. This is done using the Union-Find data structure. But detection of cycles for directed graphs fails with this method.
 
Kruskal's fails because of failure to detect cycles and sometimes it is essential to add edges making cycles to satisfy the "minimum" weighted property of MST.
